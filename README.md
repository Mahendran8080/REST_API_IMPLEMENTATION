HOW REST_API WORKS ?
Working:
A request is sent from client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT or DELETE request.
After that, a response comes back from the server in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML, Image, or JSON.
But now JSON is the most popular format being used in Web Services.
